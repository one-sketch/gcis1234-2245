            <p class="course-text">This course introduces students to computational problem-solving with a software engineering approach. Students of all skill levels—from beginners to experienced programmers—will learn fundamental programming skills using Python. The focus is on problem-solving techniques, breaking down complex problems, and software engineering best practices like design patterns, testing, and version control.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="course-text">At the start of each lecture, your instructor will provide you with the password necessary to access that day's quiz. Each quiz includes a series of questions based on topics covered in the previous lecture. The goal of the daily quizzes is twofold: first, to encourage you to arrive on time to class each and every day, and second to refresh your memory about the topics that were covered previously. If there are any questions that you are unsure about, be sure to make a note and ask your instructor during lecture! <br> </p>
                
            <p class="course-text">Quizzes are graded based on participation. Provided that the student completes the quiz in the first 5 minutes of class, they will receive full credit for that quiz. At the same time, the questions on the quizzes will be very similar to the questions on the written portion of the midterm and final exams. You would take the quizzes seriously, and ask questions if there is something on a quiz that you do not understand.</p>

            <h2 class="course-heading">Class Activities
            </h2>
            <p class="course-text">Each lecture includes 10-15 hands-on active learning activities designed to provide students with an opportunity to practice as they learn new topics in the course. Students are expected to spend about 2-5 minutes working independently on the activity. The goal is not necessarily to completely solve every activity within this short period of time but to think about how to apply what you have just learned to a potential solution. One technique is to try to write your solution as a "recipe" in the form of comments in your code. Course Assistants are available in the classroom to assist students during these activities. After enough time has passed to give everyone an opportunity to think about the problem, your instructor will go over the solution before moving on.</p>
            <p class="course-text">Class activities are graded based on participation. Graders will be looking for signs of obvious effort, including at least an attempted solution to each activity and frequent commits to source control throughout the lecture. Students that demonstrate such effort will receive full credit for the class activities.

            <h2 class="course-heading">Problem Solving
            </h2>
            <p class="course-text">The last 60 minutes of class on some days will be devted to team problem solving, during which students are placed into teams of 3-4 by their instructor and presented with a series of problems to solve together. The problems are typically directly related to that day's homework assignment. Every student on the team is expected to contribute to the team's solution. Course Assistants and your instructor will be available to assist.

            </p>
            <p class="course-text">Problem solving is graded based on participation. Students should contribute to their team's solution by actively engaging in the discussions and taking turns writing the team's solution on the whiteboard or paper. Provided that a student is present and contributing to their team's solution, they will receive full credit.

            </h2>
            <p class="course-text">Homework will be assigned at the end of most classes and is due before the start of the next class. The homework assignments provide students with an opportunity to practice what they learned during that day's lecture to solve problems that are significantly larger and more complex than the activities practiced during class. The lecture and class activities will have included everything that you need to solve your homework assignments - it is a good idea to look for problems that are similar and try to adapt the solutions to your homework. Students will have a minimum of two days to complete each assignment.  </p>
            <p class="course-text">Homework assignments are graded based on the following rubric, which evaluates effort and adherence to instructions.</p>
